## Content Guidelines

- **Keep it practical.** Prefer concrete examples over abstract theory.
- **Stay current.** Reference the latest versions of tools, frameworks, and papers.
- **Be concise.** Respect the reader's time. Say it once, say it clearly.
- **Follow existing structure.** Each lesson has Navigation headers, consistent formatting, and Previous/Next links.
- **Code examples** should be in Java (primary), Rust, or Python. Use realistic scenarios, not toy examples.
- **No placeholder API keys.** Always use environment variables in examples (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`).

## File Naming

- Modules: `XX_Module_Name/` (e.g., `03_AI_Agents_Core/`)
- Lessons: `XX_Lesson_Name.md` (e.g., `02_Agent_Architectures.md`)
- Use underscores, not spaces or hyphens
